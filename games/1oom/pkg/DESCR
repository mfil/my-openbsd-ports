1oom is a free and open source recreation of Master Of Orion 1, a
classic turn-based strategy game from 1993 developed by Simtex and
published by Microprose.  The player's goal is to expand their space
empire and ultimately rule the galaxy.  Of course, rival empires have
the same idea...

A copy of the original game is required to play.
