Game Files
==========

To run 1oom, you need the original files of Master Of Orion 1.  If you
have a CD version, you can simply copy them to your hard drive.  If you
bought the game on GOG, download its Windows installer and unpack it
using innoextract.  You will find the required files in the `app'
directory.

On the first start, you need to tell 1oom where to find the game files:

	1oom_classic_sdl2 -data /path/to/moo/files/

The location will be remembered for future starts.

Bugfixes and Improvements
=========================

By default, 1oom tries to roughly recreate the latest official version
of Master of Orion, version 1.3.  Several improvements can be enabled
optionally.  Firstly, an improved UI can be enabled with the `-uiextra'
flag, and the UI can be scaled using the `-uiscale' option.  Passing an
integer value larger than 1 allows viewing a larger portion of the map
at once than the original game.

Fixes for various bugs and bug-like behaviors which were addressed in
fan-made patches can be enabled using the modding utility 1oom_pbxmake
included with this package.  First, run

	1oom_pbxmake /usr/local/share/doc/1oom/pbxin_fixbugs.txt \
	    ~/fixbugs.pbx

and then start the game with the `-file ~/fixbugs.pbs' flag.  Note that
1oom remebers the options you used, so you do not need to type them
again on your next start.

For further documentation, see the files in /usr/local/share/doc/1oom.
