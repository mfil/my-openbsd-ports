Game Files
==========

To run 1oom, you need the original files of Master Of Orion 1.  If you
have a CD version, you can simply copy them to your hard drive.  If you
bought the game on GOG, download its Windows installer and unpack it
using innoextract.  You will find the required files in the `app'
directory.

On the first start, you need to tell 1oom where to find the game files:

	1oom_classic_sdl2 -data /path/to/moo/files/

The location will be remembered for future starts.

Options
=======

By default, 1oom tries to recreate version 1.3 of Master of Orion, the
latest official version.  Improvements from later fan-made patches can
be enabled optionally...
